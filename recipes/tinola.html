        <p>
            Chicken Tinola is a Filipino soup dish. 
            It involves cooking chicken pieces in ginger broth. 
            It is a popular cold weather dish. I always feel 
            warm and cozy every time I eat it. This Filipino Chicken 
            Soup is best enjoyed with fish sauce as dipping sauce, 
            and a cup of warm white rice.

        <p>
            Tinola is traditionally cooked with wedges of unripe 
            papaya and malunggay leaves. These components make it 
            a good source of nutrients. The secret in making a 
            good tinola is to simmer the chicken for longer periods 
            of time. This extracts the flavor from the chicken. It also 
            makes the chicken tender in the process.
