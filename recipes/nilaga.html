    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pork Nilaga is a type of Filipino pork soup in clear broth. 
            I used pork belly in this version along with other ingredients 
            such as potato, saba banana, and pechay (or baby bok choy). 
            It is a perfect dish that you can enjoy during cold and rainy weather. 
            In this nilaga version, I added Knorr Pork Cube to provide more flavor 
            to the dish.  I suggest that you serve this hot with a small bowl or saucer 
            of fish sauce (with chili pepper if you prefer it  a bit spicy) on the side.
